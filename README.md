Layout: This needs to be planned for for each Responsive Layout
it wasnt in this project and quite frankly it shows.

//Notes and Insights
Tailwind classes can be applied conditionally at breakpoints

Min-width or mobile first design principle

Arbitrary values can also be used for irregular breakpoints

Changes can also be locked within screen ranges

Always begin layout with Flexbox and Grid from mobile

Use Rems for Parent and EMs for Children- ems would need arbitrary Values
as they are not supported in default tailwind.

Look at how responsive elements change and incorporate it into layout ,
from planning stages- Use of wireframes and Sectioning
